# Concept: Single-File BibTeX Manager

This document outlines the concept, implementation progress, and architectural evolution of a bibliography manager that runs entirely within a single HTML file.

## 1. Overview

The goal is to build a simple yet powerful bibliography manager that allows a user to open a local `.bib` file in their browser to filter, sort, view, and edit entries. The entire application is self-contained in one `.html` file, requiring no installation or backend server.

### Core Principles
- **Portability:** A single HTML file that can be opened in any modern web browser.
- **No Installation:** No dependencies to install for end users. The built file contains everything needed.
- **Client-Side Only:** All logic runs in the user's browser. No data is sent to a server.
- **Local File Operation:** The user explicitly opens and saves the `.bib` file from their local machine.
- **Type Safety:** Full TypeScript coverage with structured data types.
- **Real-time Validation:** Immediate feedback with BibTeX-specific validation.

## 2. Architecture Evolution

The project has undergone a comprehensive architectural transformation from vanilla JavaScript to a sophisticated TypeScript + React implementation with advanced state management, while maintaining the single-file output requirement.

### Technology Stack
- **Frontend Framework:** React 18 with TypeScript and modern hooks patterns
- **State Management:** Custom React Context with useReducer for centralized state management
- **Validation System:** Valibot for schema-based real-time validation
- **Build Tool:** Vite with vite-plugin-singlefile
- **Styling:** CSS with CSS variables and responsive design
- **Type System:** Comprehensive TypeScript interfaces with structured BibTeX types
- **Output:** Single 172KB HTML file containing all bundled code

### Major Architectural Transformation

The application has undergone a complete architectural overhaul:

#### From Legacy to Modern Types
- **Before:** `Record<string, string>` for entry fields
- **After:** Structured TypeScript interfaces with proper types
- **Impact:** Complete type safety and better data integrity
