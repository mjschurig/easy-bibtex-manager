  abstract = {In this paper, we want to clarify the Gibbs phenomenon when continuous and discontinuous finite elements are used to approximate discontinuous or nearly discontinuous PDE solutions from the approximation point of view. For a simple step function, we explicitly compute its continuous and discontinuous piecewise constant or linear projections on discontinuity matched or non-matched meshes. For the simple discontinuity-aligned mesh case, piecewise discontinuous approximations are always good. For the general non-matched case, we explain that the piecewise discontinuous constant approximation combined with adaptive mesh refinements is a good choice to achieve accuracy without overshoots. For discontinuous piecewise linear approximations, non-trivial overshoots will be observed unless the mesh is matched with discontinuity. For continuous piecewise linear approximations, the computation is based on a “far-away assumption”, and non-trivial overshoots will always be observed under regular meshes. We calculate the explicit overshoot values for several typical cases. Numerical tests are conducted for a singularly-perturbed reaction-diffusion equation and linear hyperbolic equations to verify our findings in the paper. Also, we discuss the L1-minimization-based methods and do not recommend such methods due to their similar behavior to L2-based methods and more complicated implementations.}

It is shown that the complete cubic spline interpolation of the Heaviside step function converges in the Lp-norm at rate O(h1p) for quasi-uniform meshes when 1⩽p<∞, and diverges in the L∞-norm when the uniform meshes are used. No matter how small the uniform mesh size is, the complete cubic spline interpolation always oscillates near the discontinuity. Although this oscillation decays exponentially away from the discontinuous point, the maximum overshoot is not decreasing. Especially, we obtain the asymptotic maximum overshoot when the uniform mesh size goes to zero. The knowledge on the Heaviside function is utilized to discuss convergence properties of cubic spline interpolation for functions with isolated discontinuous points.}

Such continuity reduction results in a decrement in the interconnection between the degrees of freedom of the mesh, which allows for large computational savings during the solution of the resulting linear system. The continuity reduction results in extra degrees of freedom that modify the approximation properties of the method. The convergence rate of such refined isogeometric analysis is equivalent to that of the maximum continuity basis. We show how the breaks in continuity and inhomogeneity of the basis lead to artifacts in the frequency spectra, such as stopping bands and outliers, and present a unified description of these effects in finite element method, isogeometric analysis, and refined isogeometric analysis. Accuracy of the refined isogeometric analysis approximations can be improved by using non-standard quadrature rules. In particular, optimal quadrature rules lead to large reductions in the eigenvalue errors and yield two extra orders of convergence, as it occurs in standard isogeometric analysis.}

This was later named the Gibbs phenomenon.This article is a review of the Gibbs phenomenon from a different perspective. The Gibbs phenomenon, as we view it, deals with the issue of recovering point values of a function from its expansion coefficients. Alternatively it can be viewed as the possibility of the recovery of local information from global information. The main theme here is not the structure of the Gibbs oscillations but the understanding and resolution of the phenomenon in a general setting.The purpose of this article is to review the Gibbs phenomenon and to show that the knowledge of the expansion coefficients is sufficient for obtaining the point values of a piecewise smooth function, with the same order of accuracy as in the smooth case. This is done by using the finite expansion series to construct a different, rapidly convergent, approximation.}

Nevertheless, computational methods for estimating the eigenvalues are still of much current interest, particularly in applications to acoustic and electromagnetic waveguides. Although our primary interest is with the computational methods, there are a number of theoretical results on the behavior of the eigenvalues and eigenfunctions that are useful for understanding the methods and, in addition, are of interest in themselves. These results are discussed first and then the various computational methods that have been used to estimate the eigenvalues are reviewed with particular emphasis on methods that give error bounds. Some of the more powerful techniques available are illustrated by applying them to a model problem.}

  abstract = {Directed energy deposition processes can reduce material waste and manufacturing time of large metal parts through near net-shape production at high deposition rates. However, the localised high heat input gives rise to undesired heat accumulation, residual stresses and distortions. In this work, a fast thermal model is developed to aid in predicting and preventing these drawbacks by providing insight in the relation between process settings, deposition strategy and thermal response. Material addition and heat input are efficiently combined by adding new elements at elevated temperature. Newly deposited elements are assigned an artificially enhanced heat capacity to match the process heat input. The discontinuous Galerkin finite element method is used for spatial discretisation. The resulting numerical scheme is fully explicit and can be solved element-wise. Unlike previous prescribed-temperature heat input models, the proposed method correctly captures the process heat input, irrespective of substrate temperature and element size and without calibration. Comparison with experimental data shows that the thermal history of a large additively manufactured part can be accurately predicted.}

  abstract = {Recent developments in additive manufacturing (AM) technologies involving heat and mass deposition have exposed the need for computationally efficient modeling of thermal field histories. This is due to the effect of such histories on resulting morphologies and quantities of interest, such as micro- and meso-structure, residual strains and stresses, as well as on material and structural properties and associated functional performance at the macro-scale. Limiting undesirable manifestations of these phenomena has motivated the development of both feed-forward and feedback loop control methodologies. However, up to now the computational cost of existing methods for predicting thermal fields and associated aspects, have allowed only feed-forward control methods. Consequently, in this paper, analytic solutions are enriched and then used to model the thermal aspects of AM, in a manner that demonstrates both high computational performance and fidelity required to enable “in the loop” use for feedback control of AM processes. It is first shown that the utility of existing analytical solutions is limited due to their underlying assumptions, some of which are their derivation based on a homogeneous semi-infinite domain and temperature independent material properties among others. These solutions must therefore be enriched in order to capture the actual thermal physics associated with the relevant AM processes. Enrichments introduced herein include the handling of strong nonlinear variations in material properties due to their dependence on temperature, finite non-convex solution domains, behavior of heat sources very near domain boundaries, and mass accretion coupled to the thermal problem. The enriched analytic solution method (EASM) that implements these enrichments is shown to produce results equivalent to those of numerical methods (such as Finite Elements and Finite Differences) that require six orders of magnitude greater computational cost.}

The second bottleneck being the large and numerous linear systems to be solved arising from the use of Newton’s method to solve nonlinear systems of equations. In this paper, we will address the first issue. We will see how under mild assumptions the assemblage procedure may be rewritten using a completely loop-free algorithm. Our approach leads to a small matrix-matrix multiplication for which we may count on highly optimized algorithms.}

  abstract = {In this article we consider the numerical approximation of the convection-diffusion-reaction equation. One of the main challenges of designing a numerical method for this problem is that boundary layers occurring in the convection-dominated case can lead to non-physical oscillations in the numerical approximation, often referred to as Gibbs phenomena. The idea of this article is to consider the approximation problem as a residual minimization in dual norms in Lq-type Sobolev spaces, with 1<q<∞. We then apply a non-standard, non-linear Petrov–Galerkin discretization, that is applicable to reflexive Banach spaces such that the space itself and its dual are strictly convex. Similar to discontinuous Petrov–Galerkin methods, this method is based on minimizing the residual in a dual norm. Replacing the intractable dual norm by a suitable discrete dual norm gives rise to a non-linear inexact mixed method. This generalizes the Petrov–Galerkin framework developed in the context of discontinuous Petrov–Galerkin methods to more general Banach spaces. For the convection–diffusion–reaction equation, this yields a generalization of a similar approach from the L2-setting to the Lq-setting. A key advantage of considering a more general Banach space setting is that, in certain cases, the oscillations in the numerical approximation vanish as q tends to 1, as we will demonstrate using a few simple numerical examples.}

Thermal field evolution during the manufacturing process plays an important role in determining both geometric and mechanical properties of the fabricated parts. Thermal simulation of AM processes is challenging due to the geometric complexity of the manufacturing process and inherent computational complexity that requires a numerical solution at every time increment of the process. We propose a new general computational framework that supports scalable thermal simulation at path scale of any AM process driven by a moving heat source. The proposed framework has three novel ingredients. First, the path-level discretization is process-aware, which is based on the manufacturing primitives described by the scan path and the thermal model that is formulated directly in terms of manufacturing primitives. Second, a spatial data structure, called contact graph, is used to represent the discretized domain and capture all expected thermal interactions during the simulation. Finally, the simulation is localized based on specific physical parameters of the manufacturing process, requiring at most a constant number of updates at each time-step. The latter implies that the constructed simulation not only scales to handle three-dimensional (3D) printed components of arbitrary complexity but also can achieve real-time performance. To demonstrate the efficacy and generality of the framework, it has been successfully applied to build thermal simulations of two different AM processes: fused deposition modeling and powder bed fusion.},

AM will be consolidated as a leading technology in numerous sectors in the near future due to the maturity of the technology, the wide range of possibilities afforded by 3D printing, and the institutional push. One of the most important aspects of Industry 4.0 is 3D printing. It may be used to fabricate complicated parts and allows companies to cut inventory, develop on-demand items, create smaller localized manufacturing conditions, and even shorten supply chains. AM is expected to increase rapidly in the future because of its above stated remarkable “performance record.“ According to a report published the AM market is predicted to produce US\$2 trillion worth of components and end products by year 2030. Hence integration of smart technology and production systems or indirectly one can say that AM is promoting Industry 4.0 and it plays a pivotal role in solving some of the 4th industrial revolution’s most important needs. AM is a future paradigm for futuristic production systems, and Industry 4.0 will leverage its potential to reach essential goals. AM will be found now days in a variety of industrial applications including aerospace and health care to consumer goods.

Thus, this study is focused on quantifying model uncertainty due to the modeling assumptions, and evaluating differences based on whether or not selected physical factors are incorporated. Multiple models with different assumptions, including a high-fidelity thermal-fluid flow model resolving individual powder particles, a low-fidelity heat transfer model simplifying the powder bed as a continuum material, and a semi-analytical thermal model using a point heat source model, were run with a variety of manufacturing process parameters. Experiments were performed on the National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) Additive Manufacturing Metrology Testbed (AMMT) to validate the models. A data analytics-based methodology was utilized to characterize the models to estimate the error distribution. The cross comparison of the simulation results reveals the remarkable influence of fluid flow, while the significance of the powder layer varies across different models. This study aims to provide guidance on model selection and corresponding accuracy, and more importantly facilitate the development of AM models.}
